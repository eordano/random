Introduction
============

This simple http server library gives you:

* A request data structure with information about what the client sent.
* A response data structure that you should fill (fully customizable).
* Some helpers to easily create responses without having to fill in details.

Usage
=====

Include the file *include/lch.h* and link against lch.o to get the
functionality of the server.

Take a look at *include/http_types.h* to get a glance of what information you
get when handling a http request, and what information you should fill in.

Take a look at *include/lch_helpers.h* to see what functions are at hand when
creating the following responses:

* 200 OK
* 301 Moved Permanently
* 307 Temporary Redirect
* 404 Not Found
* 500 Internal Server Error

Start the server with a call to the function init\_lch, wich receives a
callback that will be called for each request::

    void init_lch(int port, (http_response_t* callback)(http_request_t* req));
